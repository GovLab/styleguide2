  <h1>Smarter Crowdsourcing for Zika</h1>
  <h2>and Other Mosquito Borne Diseases</h2>

<p><a href="#">The Governance Lab</a> with the support of the <a href="#">Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)</a> is launching an effort to rapidly convene global experts to assist with the identification of innovative approaches to identifying, managing and mitigating the effects of mosquito-borne diseases (MBD).</p>

<p>Building on our experience using new technology to curate and bring together experts online to work on solving hard problems, the GovLab will organize a series of online sessions between July-September 2016 to bring together experts to brainstorm innovative and practical ways to help governments in Latin America prepare for and respond to mosquito borne viruses including Zika. The goal of the initiative is to generate innovative and implementable solutions to the challenge posed by major infectious disease outbreaks in the region, in particular those transmitted by mosquitoes.</p>
 
<p>Instead of a handful of people meeting once at great expense in a conference room, we will use the Internet to make it easy for people to lend their time and know-how and deliberate with one another to identify, design and iterate upon implementable ideas that governments can use. The aim is marry the agility and diversity of crowdsourcing (also called open innovation) with curation to target those with relevant know-how and bring them together in a format designed to produce effective and implementable outcomes. This more targeted form of crowdsourcing, which quickly matches the demand for expertise to the supply of it, is what we call “smarter crowdsourcing.”</p>
 
<h2>Project Phases</h2>
<p>Partner and Problem Identification: The GovLab, IDB and Latin American partner governments at the federal, state and local level agree on partnership and identify core problems to address. Combatting MBD can be broken down into a series of smaller problems to be tackled. The problems will focus on those which government can tackle.</p>

<h3>Problem Definition</h3>
<p>GovLab briefs each challenge in English, Spanish and Portuguese. Briefings will be posted online for public comment. The briefings will inform the agenda and discussion for the online dialogues. From the problem briefs, partners (with public input) will prioritize the topics. Each topic will be the subject of an online conference.</p>

<h3>Curating Guests</h3>
<p>Diverse experts and innovators – from practitioners and technologists to policymakers and researchers – are identified and invited to participate in one or more online conferences, matching their expertise to the topics. Guest lists are posted online for public input and suggestion of additional experts who should participate. The focus will be on finding those with innovative yet practical approaches to tackling identified problems.</p>

<h3>Online Conferences</h3>
<p>Each two-hour discussion will be  focused on a specific problem. The most promising ideas will be developed into proposals for implementation. Videos, transcripts and post-conference briefings of each discussion to be posted online for comment.</p>

<h3>Results & Impact</h3>
<p>The project aims to generate innovative and implementable solutions that help governments prepare for and respond to mosquito borne illnesses. It will also create an informal, rapid and agile network of experts to get in good ideas for tackling the mosquito borne pandemics and making government more effective.</p>
